---
## Optimization and Engineering 

- __[The mutation repository:](https://github.com/hernaneBraga/Evolutionary_Computing)__ projects implemented on the Evolutionary Computing course using Jupyter Notebooks and Python. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are applied to solve The N-queens problem, the Knapsack problem, and the Weasel Program.  Application of Differential Evolution (DE) and Participle Optimization Swarm (PSO) methods to optimize non-convex multimodal functions. 

- __[Dynamic Systems Modeling:](https://github.com/hernaneBraga/Dynamic_Systems_Modeling)__ using parametric and non-parametric methods for modeling the transfer function on a linear dynamic system. Undergrad projects for the Dynamic Systems Modeling at UFMG.

- __[Choosing the best way:](https://github.com/hernaneBraga/TD)__ finding the best solution for 250 instances of a multi-objective Sales Man Problem (TSP) using Simulated Annealing (SA) neighborhood structures. The problem solutions were analyzed and selected using decision theory methods: Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), ELECTRE I, and PROMETHEE II. Undergrad project for the Decision Theory course.

- __[Optimizing drunkness and bar bills:](https://github.com/hernaneBraga/Pesquisa-Operacional-UFMG)__ the Knapsack problem was applied to safely optimize the money spent and the Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC). Undergrad project for Operation Research course.

## Data Science and Computer Vision

- __[AceleraDev Data Science:](https://github.com/hernaneBraga/AceleraDev-Data_Science)__ Career Acceleration Program in Data Science by former Codenation, now known as Trybe.

- __[Pika Pika! Pikachu! (but in augmented reality):](https://github.com/hernaneBraga/Visual_Computing/tree/master/Pikachu%20augmented%20reality)__ rendering a 3D Pikachu on an augmented reality marker. Coded step-by-step in Jupyter notebook using Python, OpenCV, and OpenGL.

- __[Finding stars:](https://github.com/hernaneBraga/Pattern_Recognition_UFMG)__ Pattern recognition course final project, predicting Pulsar Stars using SMOTE for data balancing, and SVM for classification.

- __[Image compression:](https://github.com/hernaneBraga/Visual_Computing/tree/master/Image%20compression)__ Python notebook implementing an algorithm for image compression and decompression using frequency analysis and Huffman coding.

- __[Data Structures and Algorithms:](https://github.com/hernaneBraga/Data_Structures_Algorithms)__ computer science fundamentals. Graphs, external sorting, programming paradigms, etc., implementations in C.
